          <h2>But what about the roads?</h2>
          <p>
            You just don’t understand economics, like supply and demand. Don’t
            worry kiddo, when there’s a demand there will be a supply; we’ll all
            have our roads.

          <h2>Is taxation theft?</h2>
          <p>
            If citizens force you to share heavily armed bullies, demanded that
            you and your neighbors give them a percentage of your income, is
            that theft? The government does that very thing, yet you didn’t ask
            for it. Would you consider that theft?

          <h2>So, what you’re saying is…?</h2>
          <p>
            Libertarians want to live in a world where gay couples can protect
            their property rights with fully automatic weapons.
          </p>
          <p>
            A world where voluntaryism and property rights are treated with the
            highest respect.
